# Hi, I’m Bisola 
I am a **Data Scientist** passionate about using data, machine learning and deep learning to extract insights and build practical solutions.  


-  I build machine learning / deep-learning / data-analysis projects (see pinned repositories below)  
-  Always happy to collaborate on interesting data-science / ML / analytics projects  
- You can find me on linkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/in/bisola-akinkuolie-3bba01166


##  Skills & Tools

| Area | Technologies |
|------|--------------|
| Programming / Data wrangling | Python, SQL |
| Data Analysis & Visualization | Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib / Seaborn (or any plotting libs) |
| Machine Learning & Deep Learning | scikit-learn, TensorFlow / Keras (or other DL frameworks) |
| ML Workflow & Experimentation | Jupyter Notebooks, project structuring, data cleaning / preprocessing |
| Concepts | Classification, regression, predictive maintenance, image classification, time-series / tabular modelling |



##  Projects & What I’ve Built

Here are some of my notable projects (scroll down to repositories for code & details):

- **Customer Churn Prediction with SHAP explainability** :using ML to predict ML and providing explainability as to why an individual is likely to churn or why customers in a particulat section are likely to churn.  
- **Predictive Maintenance System** : using machine learning (and optionally deep learning) for predictive maintenance on industrial data.  
- **Soligence App for Crypto Prediction** : a project exploring crypto-market prediction.  
- **End-to-End Heart Disease Classification**: usage of ML to predict patients who are likely to have heart disease.
- **Data Cleaning in SQL** :SQL-based data cleaning & preprocessing utilities / examples.



##  What I’m Looking For;Where I’m Headed

- Collaborating on **open-source data science or ML projects** : especially ones needing data-cleaning, model prototyping, or dataset preprocessing.  
- Building **end-to-end ML / DL pipelines** :from data ingestion and cleaning to modelling and evaluation.  
- Exploring **deep learning for computer vision** and **predictive analytics / time-series forecasting / maintenance or business use-cases**.  
- Improving code organization, documentation, and reproducibility (notebooks → scripts / modules), to boost project clarity & maintainability.

##  What I Believe In

- Code + data is great : but **documentation and clarity matter more** for usability and collaboration.  
- Share your work, even ssmall utilities, data-cleaning notebooks, helper scripts, analyses; they build up over time.  
- Open-source contributions (not just big projects) even documentation improvements, data-wrangling scripts or demo notebooks: are valuable.
