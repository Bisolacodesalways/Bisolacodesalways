# Hi, I’m Bisola 
I am a **Data Scientist** passionate about using data, machine learning and deep learning to extract insights and build practical solutions.  


- 🔭 I build machine learning / deep-learning / data-analysis projects (see pinned repositories below)  
- 💬 Always happy to collaborate on interesting data-science / ML / analytics projects  
- 📫 You can find me on linkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/in/bisola-akinkuolie-3bba01166


##  Skills & Tools

| Area | Technologies |
|------|--------------|
| Programming / Data wrangling | Python, SQL |
| Data Analysis & Visualization | Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib / Seaborn (or any plotting libs) |
| Machine Learning & Deep Learning | scikit-learn, TensorFlow / Keras (or other DL frameworks) |
| ML Workflow & Experimentation | Jupyter Notebooks, project structuring, data cleaning / preprocessing |
| Concepts | Classification, regression, predictive maintenance, image classification, time-series / tabular modelling |



##  Projects & What I’ve Built

Here are some of my notable projects (scroll down to repositories for code & details):

- **Car Manufacture Project** — data analysis for a car manufacturing business case.  
- **ADIBOT – Chatbot Project** — a prototype chatbot for customer-centric logistics / support in the retail domain.  
- **Predictive Maintenance System** — using machine learning (and optionally deep learning) for predictive maintenance on industrial data.  
- **Soligence App for Crypto Prediction** — a project exploring crypto-market prediction.  
- **Dog Vision (with TensorFlow)** — deep-learning model to identify dog breeds from images.  
- **Data Cleaning in SQL** — SQL-based data cleaning & preprocessing utilities / examples.



##  What I’m Looking For / Where I’m Headed

- Collaborating on **open-source data science or ML projects** — especially ones needing data-cleaning, model prototyping, or dataset preprocessing.  
- Building **end-to-end ML / DL pipelines** — from data ingestion and cleaning to modelling and evaluation.  
- Exploring **deep learning for computer vision** and **predictive analytics / time-series forecasting / maintenance or business use-cases**.  
- Improving code organization, documentation, and reproducibility (notebooks → scripts / modules), to boost project clarity & maintainability.

##  What I Believe In

- Code + data is great — but **documentation and clarity matter more** for usability and collaboration.  
- Share your work, even small — small utilities, data-cleaning notebooks, helper scripts, analyses — they build up over time.  
- Open-source contributions (not just big projects) — even documentation improvements, data-wrangling scripts or demo notebooks — are valuable.
